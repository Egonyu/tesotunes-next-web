- **Effort:** Implement 2-3 days each, or remove 5 minutes each
- **Status:** [x] Completed
- **Date Fixed:** Feb 23, 2026
- [x] `routes/api/social.php` — **Populated** with artist follow, comments, shares, activity interaction routes
- [x] `routes/api/ecommerce.php` — **Removed** (redundant, store.php + Store module handles this)
- [x] `routes/api/engagement.php` — **Populated** with polls and awards routes (moved from inline api.php)
- [x] `routes/api/loyalty.php` — **Removed** (no implementation exists)

---

## ⚠️ HIGH Priority Issues

### H1. No Rate Limiting on API Routes
- **Impact:** API abuse, DDoS vulnerability
- **Effort:** 15 minutes
- **Status:** [x] Completed
- **Date Fixed:** Feb 23, 2026
- [x] ~~Add `throttle:api` middleware~~ — Enabled via `$middleware->throttleApi('api')` in bootstrap/app.php
- [x] Rate limits already configured in `AppServiceProvider::configureRateLimiting()` (100/min auth, 20/min guest)
- [ ] Test throttle behavior

### H2. Permissive CORS Configuration
- **Impact:** ~~Security vulnerability — allows all origins (`*`)~~ **FALSE ALARM**
- **Effort:** N/A
- **Status:** [x] Already configured correctly
- **Date Fixed:** N/A (was never broken)
- **Notes:** CORS config already restricts origins to localhost, tesotunes.test, tesotunes.com, and subdomains via pattern. `supports_credentials: true` is set.

### H3. Raw SQL Queries (17 Found)
- **Impact:** ~~Potential SQL injection~~ **Low risk — reviewed and safe**
- **Effort:** N/A
- **Status:** [x] Reviewed
- **Date Fixed:** Feb 23, 2026
- [x] Found 38 `DB::raw` instances (not 17 as originally estimated)
- [x] All are safe static aggregation functions: COUNT(), SUM(), DATE(), DATE_FORMAT(), COALESCE()
- [x] No user input interpolation detected — no SQL injection risk
- **Remaining:** StoreApiController correlated subqueries could be refactored to Eloquent relationships for cleanliness (non-security)

### H4. Mass Assignment Protection Missing on Featurable
- **Impact:** ~~Potential mass assignment vulnerability~~ **FALSE ALARM**
- **Effort:** N/A
- **Status:** [x] Reviewed — not an issue
- **Date Fixed:** N/A
- **Notes:** Featurable is a trait (not a model). Mass assignment protection (`$fillable`/`$guarded`) is defined on the models using the trait, not on the trait itself. The trait's `update()` calls use the model's own protection.

### H5. Missing Controller References in Routes
- **Impact:** ~~Routes returning 404/500 errors~~ **No issues found**
- **Effort:** N/A
- **Status:** [x] Verified
- **Date Fixed:** Feb 23, 2026
- [x] Ran `php artisan route:list` — all 458 API routes compile successfully
- [x] No missing controller references found

### H6. Duplicate/Conflicting Migrations
- **Impact:** Migration failures, schema inconsistency
- **Effort:** 1-2 hours
- **Status:** [ ] Not started
- **Date Fixed:** ___
- [ ] Run `php artisan migrate:status` to check state
- [ ] Identify duplicate table modifications
- [ ] Consolidate or sequence migrations properly
- [ ] Run `php check_schema.php` for conflicts

### H7. Implement or Remove Stub Route Files
- **Impact:** ~~Confusion, dead code~~ **Resolved**
- **Effort:** Completed
- **Status:** [x] Completed
- **Date Fixed:** Feb 23, 2026

| Module | Decision | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| social.php | [x] Keep | Populated with artist follow, comments, shares, activity routes |
| ecommerce.php | [x] Remove | Redundant — store.php + Store module covers this |
| engagement.php | [x] Keep | Populated with polls & awards routes |
| loyalty.php | [x] Remove | No implementation exists |
| wazuh.php | [x] Remove | No implementation; config/services.php entry retained |

### H8. Auth Route File Minimal
- **Impact:** ~~Incomplete authentication flow~~ **Resolved**
- **Effort:** Completed
- **Status:** [x] Completed
- **Date Fixed:** Feb 23, 2026
- [x] Added missing auth routes: logout, refresh, user (to routes/api/auth.php)
- [x] Added same routes to the /api/auth/* prefix group in api.php for frontend compatibility
- [x] Full auth flow: login, register, logout, refresh, user
